# Surfs Up Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to compile the proper metrics to present my business plan for a surf & shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii to my investor W. Avy.

# Analysis Results

- In my analysis I found that June was a really good month in terms of temperature. In plotting all of the June temperatures from 2010 - 2017, the bulk of the temperatures fell between 67 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit. There were very few outliers of days where the temperature exceeded these ranges. Knowing that the temperature is not much warmer in June, we can assure our investor this is a sustainable month.

- By comparison, the other month that our investor was worried about was the month of December for a sustainable year-round operation. When plotting all of the December temperatures from 2010 - 2017, the bulk of the temperatures fell between 67 and 76 degrees Fahrenheit. There were few outliers where temperatures fell outside of this range. Knowing that the temperature is not much cooler than this range in December, we can assure our investor this is a sustainable month.

- The maximum temperature found across all years of June, at 85 degrees, is just slightly higher than the maximum temperature found in December, at 83 degrees. We also determined that the month of December is slightly cooler than June - with an average temperautre at 71 degrees compared to an average temperature of 75 degrees in June.


# Summary of Analysis

Based on the analysis of temperatures in Oahu, Hawaii in June and December - we are able to report that all months of the year will have moderate temperatures that will allow for a year-round sustainable business operation.

To properly confirm this business plan is sound, I would recommend to run two additional queries and further data exploration to complete our business plan.

The first query that should be written and analyzed would be to map out precipitation for the months of June and December. While we have found that temperatures are consistent across these months - if there is a lot of precipitation we will not have customers wanting to travel to our shake shop or to go surfing.

The second query that should be written is to narrow our results further from stations that are nearest to our proposed location of our surf and shake shop. With elevation and vegetation varying across the Hawaiian island - our data may be skewed for higher or lower temperatures at different elevations. By performing this analysis using the two closest stations to our location - we can accurately depict weather patterns in that area.
